This is the R code for calculating Single Target - Implicit Association Test (ST-IAT) according to the D-600 algorithm. 
If you want to find the whole code of the computing process, please check the 'Complete Code' file, other files contain procedural code. The 'Complete Code' starts with tailored data mergeing, pre-processing, cleaning and transformation. Therefore, please make changes to your own code if you have different data structure.
The notes in the R script are in Chinese, I will also add a Chinese version soon :).
